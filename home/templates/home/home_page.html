    <h1 style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-large;">Wagtail (CMS)</h1>
    
    <p>Wagtail is a free and open source content management system (CMS) written in Python. It is popular amongst websites using the Django framework. The project is maintained by a team of open-source contributors backed by companies around the world. The project has a focus on developer friendliness as well as ease of use of its administration interface, translated in multiple languages.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;"">History</h3>

    <p>The Wagtail project was started in 2014 by Torchbox, a digital agency. The development of the CMS evolved from being the sole action of its creators to receiving contributions from 46 external contributors by its version 1.0 in July 2015. Since then, development sprints have been organised to foster the community. During those sprints, contributors gather to work on selected topics and steer the project. As of July 2016, 257 people have directly contributed to the code and translations. In January 2017 the core development team has increased to nine developers and the main GitHub repository moved from the Torchbox namespace to a dedicated Wagtail namespace.</p>
